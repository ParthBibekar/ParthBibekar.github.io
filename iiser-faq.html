                        <h2>Introduction</h2>

                        <p>
                            As a PhD student, my life often swings between
                            intense work phases and spontaneous breaks born out
                            of sheer exhaustion. It's a rhythm I've come to
                            accept—bursts of productivity followed by
                            much-needed downtime. During one such recent break,
                            I found myself scrolling through
                            <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iiser/"
                                target="_blank"
                                class="custom-link"
                                >r/iiser</a
                            >, a subreddit I've been passively subscribed to for
                            quite a while. To my surprise, the community seemed
                            more active than ever, with prospective students,
                            current undergrads, and alumni all engaging in
                            conversations about life at the IISERs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Reading through the posts made me realize something:
                            while there's a lot of curiosity around the IISERs,
                            there's still a noticeable gap in easily accessible
                            and consolidated information. So I thought—why not
                            write something myself?
                        </p>

                            This blog is my attempt to answer some of the most
                            common questions I've seen, in a concise FAQ style.
                            Whether you're a high school student contemplating
                            your future, a parent trying to understand these
                            institutions, or just someone curious about
                            interdisciplinary science in India—I hope this
                            helps.

                        <h3>A bit about me:</h3>

                        <p>
                            I'm currently pursuing a PhD at EPFL in Switzerland,
                            nearing the end of my first year. I graduated in
                            2024 with a BS-MS dual degree from IISER Kolkata,
                            majoring in Biology and minoring in Computational
                            and Data Sciences. My PhD work lies broadly in the
                            field of molecular bioengineering, with a specific
                            focus on engineering RNA using a mix of
                            computational approaches—ranging from machine
                            learning to physics-based simulations like molecular
                            dynamics. It's a blend of biology, chemistry,
                            physics, and computer science—all disciplines that
                            the IISERs aim to integrate and nurture.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When I first joined IISER Kolkata back in 2019, I
                            was filled with excitement—but also burdened with
                            questions, misconceptions, and uncertainties. One of
                            the most helpful resources I came across was a blog

                            some parts are a little dated now, it remains a

                        <h3>FAQ #1: What are IISERs?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Indian Institutes of Science Education and
                            Research (IISERs) are a group of autonomous
                            institutions established by the Government of India
                            under the Ministry of Education. Their mission is to
                            promote high-quality education and cutting-edge
                            research in the natural sciences.
                        </p>

                        <p>There are currently seven IISERs, located in:</p>

                        <ul class="blog-list">
                            <li>IISER Kolkata (West Bengal)</li>
                            <li>IISER Pune (Maharashtra)</li>
                            <li>IISER Mohali (Punjab)</li>
                            <li>IISER Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh)</li>
                            <li>IISER Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala)</li>
                            <li>IISER Tirupati (Andhra Pradesh)</li>
                            <li>IISER Berhampur (Odisha)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Think of IISERs as similar to IITs or IIMs, but
                            focused specifically on basic science and research,
                            rather than engineering or management. Their goal is
                            to nurture the next generation of scientists by
                            fostering a research-driven academic environment
                            from the undergraduate level itself.

                            FAQ #3: How do I prepare for the IISER Aptitude Test
                            (IAT)?
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            I gave the IAT back in 2019, so I'm a bit out of
                            touch with the latest exam patterns and strategies.
                            However, I came across a great resource by Arpita
                            Bhat (IISER Tirupati) that serves as a fantastic
                            starting point for anyone preparing for the exam.

                            It covers everything from the syllabus to
                            preparation tips and recommended materials. You can

                            FAQ #4: How Do I Select My Preference for IISERs?
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            This is one of the most common questions I get, and
                            the answer may surprise you:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>There's no fixed rule.</strong> Unlike JEE
                            ranks for IITs or cutoffs for NITs, IISERs don't
                            follow a strict hierarchy. You'll often hear debates
                            like "Is Pune better than Kolkata?" or "Should I
                            avoid Tirupati?" — and while some of this is rooted
                            in experience, most of it is
                            <strong>subjective and nuanced</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>So how do you choose?</p>
                        <p>Let's break it down:</p>

                        <h4>Age ≠ Quality, But It Affects Maturity</h4>
                        <p>
                            Older IISERs like <strong>Pune</strong>,
                            <strong>Kolkata</strong>, <strong>Mohali</strong>,
                            <strong>Bhopal</strong>, and
                            <strong>Thiruvananthapuram</strong> generally have:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="blog-list">
                            <li>More established departments</li>
                            <li>Larger faculties</li>
                            <li>Better-developed campuses</li>
                            <li>More alumni and networks</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            But that doesn't mean the newer IISERs —
                            <strong>Tirupati</strong> and
                            <strong>Berhampur</strong> — are "bad." Far from it.
                            Many of them are <strong>growing rapidly</strong>,
                            and being in a newer institute can give you
                            <strong
                                >more room for leadership, experimentation, and
                                visibility</strong
                            >. Some of the most enthusiastic and proactive
                            students I know are from the newer IISERs.

                        <p>
                            This is where it gets more personal. If you
                            <strong>already know</strong> you love
                            <em>physics, biology,</em> or
                            <em>earth science</em>, look at the strength of that
                            department in each IISER.

                            One (imperfect but informative) way to assess this
                            is via <strong>Nature Index Rankings</strong>, which
                            reflect publication output in top-tier journals.

                            It doesn't measure teaching quality or your
                            classroom experience. It mostly reflects the
                            <strong>research output</strong> of departments —
                            and indirectly, their <strong>size</strong>.

                        <h3>FAQ #6: How do I choose a major?</h3>
                        <p>
                            One interesting trend I've noticed recently is that
                            many IISER aspirants already have a very specific
                            research interest
                            <strong>before even joining</strong> the institute.
                            Common buzzwords include
                            <strong>astrophysics</strong>,
                            <strong>quantum computing</strong>,
                            <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>,
                            <strong>AI for genetic engineering</strong>,
                            <strong>cosmology</strong>, and similar futuristic
                            fields.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While it's
                            <strong>great to see such enthusiasm</strong>, my
                            honest advice is: <strong>have patience</strong> and
                            <strong>give yourself the space to explore</strong>.
                            The way science is taught in +2 (Class 11–12) is
                            very different from how you'll experience it at
                            IISERs. Once you start taking real university-level
                            courses, your interests may shift—and that's
                            perfectly normal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've known people who entered IISERs determined to
                            pursue astrophysics, but eventually fell in love
                            with <strong>ecology</strong>,
                            <strong>geology</strong>, or even
                            <strong>computational biology</strong>. These are
                            not fallback options—they're just
                            <strong>equally rich, exciting areas</strong> that
                            people discover along the way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So don't box yourself into one field too early just
                            because it sounds cool or trendy. Instead:

                            that time to really explore. Keeping an open mind is
                            one of the best decisions you can make early in your

                        <p>
                            Student life at IISERs can vary
                            <strong>a lot</strong> depending on your year, your

                        <p>
                            In my experience at <strong>IISER Kolkata</strong>,
                            the <strong>first two years</strong> were the most
                            academically packed. There's a fixed common
                            curriculum, lots of coursework, and adjusting to the
                            new system takes time. But as you move forward,
                            things start becoming more flexible—<strong

                            >. For example, by the 4th year, I was mostly
                            focused on research. For some courses, I didn't even
                            attend lectures—I spent my time learning specific
                            skills and working in a lab instead.

                        <p>
                            One thing to know is that

                            how many activities, clubs, or research
                            opportunities you choose to take on.

                            that means diving deep into research, playing

                            all of the above.

                            institute to another, but some core themes remain
                            the same—vibrant student communities, a wide range

                            IISc, NISER, and CEBS compete in a range of sports.
                            Even if you're not on the team, the event is a great
                            way to be involved in something exciting, and many

                            Each summer, you'll get around
                            <strong>2.5 months of vacation</strong>, and many
                            students choose to do internships for
                            <strong>1–2 months</strong> during this break. These
                            internships can be a great way to explore research,
                            gain skills, and build academic relationships.

                            This is

                            If you find a professor whose work you genuinely
                            find interesting, consider writing them a
                            <strong>short, personalized email</strong>
                            expressing your interest. Here are some tips:

                                <strong>why you'd like to work with them</strong

                            This strategy works not only in India but
                            <strong>anywhere in the world</strong>. Email profs
                            at top institutes abroad — not for the "abroad" tag,
                            but because you find their science fascinating. A
                            foreign internship
                            <strong>isn't automatically more valuable</strong>
                            than one in India — what matters most is your
                            curiosity and what you learn.

                            Can internships lead to long-term opportunities?
                        </h4>
                        <p>Yes — absolutely. Here are two personal examples:</p>
                        <ul class="blog-list">

                                After my second year, I interned with
                                <strong>Prof. Neelanjana Sengupta</strong> at
                                IISER Kolkata's <strong>mCED group</strong>. I
                                continued working with her lab even after summer
                                because I was genuinely interested. Over the
                                next couple of years, I gained valuable research
                                experience and even published a paper.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After my third year, I wrote to
                                <strong>Prof. Matteo Dal Peraro</strong> at
                                <strong>EPFL</strong> because I found his work
                                at the interface of ML and molecular modeling
                                exciting. We applied for the
                                <strong>ThinkSwiss Research Scholarship</strong
                                >, and I got to work at EPFL for a summer. I
                                liked it so much that I went back for my
                                master's thesis — and I'm now doing my
                                <strong>PhD in the same lab</strong>.

                            You don't need to follow this exact path — I just
                            want to show that meaningful internships often come
                            from
                            <strong>deep engagement and continuity</strong>, not
                            just sending dozens of random emails.

                                first summer learning skills, building a
                                foundation, and figuring out what excites you.
                                That investment will pay off.

                            Internships are not limited to just the summer. You
                            can also get involved with research during the
                            semester. If there’s a professor whose work you find
                            interesting, don’t hesitate to reach out to them
                            even during the academic term. You might be able to
                            work on a small project alongside your coursework.
                            In fact, many students at IISERs start getting
                            involved in labs from their second or third year
                            onwards. These semester-long projects can be less
                            intensive than summer internships but still provide
                            deep insights into scientific research and help you
                            build long-term mentorships. The bottom line: stay
                            curious, keep exploring, and don’t rush. Good things
                            come when you invest sincerely in what you’re
                            learning.

                        <p>
                            Alright, this is a big one. Many of you aspirants
                            and parents — this is what you've been waiting for.
                            You went to IISER, studied high-level science, did
                            your internships, struggled through your exams...
                            what next?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well, the answer is more open-ended than you might
                            expect. So let's break it down into smaller
                            questions to make things clearer.

                        <p>
                            IISERs are designed to train you in the sciences.
                            They're not meant to guarantee a job or position
                            afterward. That might sound harsh, but it's
                            important to understand:
                            <strong
                                >there is no single, clear, full-and-final plan

                            >. That's not a flaw of the system — it's just how
                            science (and life) works. The world of research is
                            full of uncertainties. But that doesn't make it
                            bleak — in fact, it means it's flexible, creative,
                            and full of options.

                            PhD applications are like summer internship
                            applications — just more intense. It takes

                        <p>
                            There are several entrance exams to become eligible
                            for PhD programs in India:

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            These exams are quite competitive, and they make you

                            <strong>IISERs, IITs, NITs, IISc</strong>, and more.
                            Once you apply, you may be shortlisted for
                            interviews — again, highly competitive.

                        <p>
                            If selected, you'll start your PhD with a stipend of
                            around <strong>₹37,000–₹45,000 per month</strong>,
                            depending on the fellowship and year of study. If
                            you're very fortunate, you might even get the
                            prestigious <strong>PMRF</strong>, which offers
                            <strong>₹80,000/month</strong>.

                            A PhD in India typically lasts
                            <strong>5–6 years</strong>.

                            <strong>Fun fact</strong>: If your CGPA is above 8
                            at IISER, you're
                            <strong>automatically eligible</strong> for a direct
                            interview at IISc for many programs.

                        <p>
                            I know many people doing excellent research during
                            their PhDs in India — the research community here is
                            vibrant and growing.

                        <h5>PhD Abroad</h5>
                        <p>
                            In developed countries, the application processes
                            and benefits vary widely.

                                In the <strong>US</strong>, you typically apply
                                via centralized university portals. If
                                shortlisted, you're called for interviews.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In <strong>Europe</strong>, although similar
                                routes exist, it's more common to directly email
                                professors for open funded positions.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>How is the pay?</h5>
                        <p>
                            PhD stipends abroad vary a lot, but are usually
                            enough to
                            <strong>live comfortably and save</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, I'll be transparent — I currently do my
                            PhD at <strong>EPFL, Switzerland</strong>.

                                My annual salary is around
                                <strong>56,000 CHF</strong> (~₹58 LPA).

                                After taxes, I take home
                                <strong>~3550 CHF/month</strong>, plus a 13th
                                salary bonus.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I save <strong>~1000 CHF/month</strong> despite
                                a fairly comfortable lifestyle (eating out,
                                traveling, investing, etc.).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            This is on the higher end, but many western PhD
                            programs provide similar quality of life and
                            financial stability.
                        </p>

                        <h5>What does PhD life look like?</h5>
                        <p>
                            It varies greatly based on your lab and field. Since
                            I'm in a <strong>computational lab</strong>, I have
                            flexible working hours. I usually work
                            <strong>9 to 5</strong>, sometimes more, sometimes
                            less. On weekends, I travel around, hang out with
                            friends, go for hikes, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But this isn't universal — some labs can be very
                            demanding, and experiences can range from "amazing"
                            to "exhausting." Most people fall somewhere in
                            between.
                        </p>

                        <h5>How hard is it to get a PhD?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Depends on where you apply.
                            <strong>Ivy League or top European schools</strong>
                            are obviously very competitive, but not out of
                            reach. If you're committed to research, IISER can
                            place you in a strong position for PhD programs.
                        </p>

                        <h5>What CGPA do I need?</h5>
                        <p>Honestly, <strong>CGPA is overrated</strong>.</p>
                        <p>
                            Yes, it can help you clear initial filters. But
                            beyond that, what matters more is:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="blog-list">
                            <li>Strong fundamentals</li>
                            <li>Hands-on research experience</li>
                            <li>Projects and internships</li>
                            <li>Letters of recommendation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Above a CGPA of ~8, all these other factors matter
                            <strong>more</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <h4>What after PhD?</h4>
                        <p>Here are some typical directions:</p>

                        <h5>Postdoc</h5>
                        <p>
                            A temporary (1–3 years) research position to build
                            your scientific independence. Crucial if you're
                            aiming for a faculty role.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Academia</h5>
                        <p>
                            With a strong postdoc and good publications, you can
                            apply to research/teaching roles in IISERs, IITs, or
                            abroad. Competitive, but meaningful if you love
                            science and mentoring.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Industry R&D</h5>
                        <p>
                            Many IISER PhDs work in R&D at companies like TCS
                            Research, AstraZeneca, Siemens, or biotech firms.
                            Particularly true for those in applied/computational
                            domains.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Startups & Entrepreneurship</h5>
                        <p>
                            Several alumni go on to create startups — often at
                            the interface of science, health, and AI.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Non-traditional paths</h5>
                        <p>Many also move to:</p>
                        <ul class="blog-list">
                            <li>Government and policy roles</li>
                            <li>Data science / analytics</li>
                            <li>Consulting / Finance / Product roles</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Your PhD trains you in
                            <strong>problem-solving</strong>, and that's valued
                            in many fields.
                        </p>

                        />

                        <h4>What if I don't want to do a PhD?</h4>
                        <p>That's perfectly fine.</p>
                        <p>Many IISER grads:</p>

                            <li>

                                <strong>tech roles</strong> (software, data
                                science)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Work in <strong>consulting or finance</strong>

                        <p>
                            The number of such alternate paths is
                            <strong>growing every year</strong>, and so is the
                            community of alumni supporting each other.
